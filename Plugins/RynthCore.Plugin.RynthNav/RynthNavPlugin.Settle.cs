// (10-01 20:55: Recall Aphus Lassel jumped at 12.5 s, portal space 12.9-19.4 s). Moving on at the
// jump started the Town Network portal step while the recall's portal space was still to come, and
// that portal space's end was then taken for the Town Network portal firing.
// Settled = out of portal space for SettleQuietMs, after portal space was seen (or SettleNoPortalMs
// passed without any).
