/// <see cref="EnqueueItem"/> when it is confirmed. Every such item is TRACKED until it has
/// been salvaged or has left the pack, and a sweep every couple of seconds queues tracked
/// items that are in the pack. Before 2026-10-02 the queue was the only record: a pickup
/// whose confirm was lost (busy reset, corpse closed), an item salvaged before it reached
/// the pack, a missing UST, or three failed tries dropped the item for good, and it sat in
/// the pack.
///
/// Flow per batch (up to <see cref="MaxBatchItems"/> items in one panel cycle):
///   Idle → UseObject(UST), wait OpenDelay
///        → SalvagePanelAddItem each item (AddDelayFast apart), plus matching under-full bags
///        → SalvagePanelExecute, wait SalvageDelay
///        → poll until the items leave the pack (or ResultMaxWaitMs) → one summary log line
/// Items that are worn, retained, on the Items list or the UST itself are skipped with the
/// reason in the log; RynthAi never takes off anything the character is wearing.
///
/// First-open delays (400ms/600ms) let the panel animate open and the gmSalvageUI singleton
/// hook fire before we make thiscall instance calls. Fast delays (50ms) apply once the panel
