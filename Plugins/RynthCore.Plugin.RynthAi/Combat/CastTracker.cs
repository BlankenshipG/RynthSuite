/// <summary>
/// Bookkeeping for the casts BuffManager sends (buffs and vitals): when each one went out,
/// when its incantation ("You say, ...") arrived, and whether the server has finished it.
///
/// Why (Drakkon on DreamWeave, 2026-10-05, ops\overnight\2026-10-05-stuck-cast.md):
///   * The give-up timers ran from the SEND. A healthy DreamWeave vital takes 2.2-2.5 s from
///     its incantation to its result, and the incantation lags the send by up to 1.2 s, so a
///     cast the server was still finishing was given up at 2.5 s and the next one drew
///     "You're too busy!". Now the give-up runs from the incantation when one arrives
///     (<see cref="GiveUpAt"/>), capped, and from the send when none does.
///   * "Has the server finished?" cleared on ANY UseDone, including the 0x1D refusal of the
///     next cast. Now only a completion that belongs to the outstanding cast counts: its own
///     result line, or a UseDone with no error after its incantation (<see cref="AwaitingServer"/>).
///     A refusal is a refusal, not "done".
///   * A cast the server held open (incantation, no result) was only released when someone
///     moved the character. <see cref="Refusal"/> says when to send one movement nudge.
///   * Each cast's time from incantation to result is logged ([CastTime]), so a slow or held
///     cast shows in the log.
///
/// Pure bookkeeping: it never calls the game. The clock is injectable for the tests.
